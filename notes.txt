Trello scrum board

Scrum master: Henry

Stories break down into tasks.
Tasks uploaded to git, create pull requests for peer review and ultimately trainer review.

Story estimations:

Story 1:
As a collector
I want to be able to see stored information about my collection
So that I can show off to my friends

5 points

Story 2:
As a collector
I want to be able to add new items to my collection
So that I can expand my collection

3 points

Git structure

main
  ↪ story1-{story name}
    ↪ s1task1-{task name}
    ↪ s1task2-{task name}
    ↪ s1task3-{task name}
  ↪ story2-{story name}
    ↪ s2task1-{task name}
    ↪ s2task2-{task name}
	
	
When you have finished a task, you will make a pull request for peer review.
Once peer reviewed, merge into main.
Once story completed it is ready for trainer review.

.DS_Store (gitignore)

git checkout -b story1_mvp

git checkout -b story1_wireframe

----------------------------------------------------
ADD THIS TO SNIPPETS:
UPDATE `films`
SET `Language` = REPLACE(`Language`, CHAR(13), '');
So, there were [character code 13] items at the end of each Language` string. This is how I got rid of them.
